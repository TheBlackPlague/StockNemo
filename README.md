### Building from Source
It is recommended that you do not build from source and instead download a 
release binary. The `master` branch, as well as other branches are in no shape,
or form, guaranteed to be production-ready or stable. 

Given the risks, if you still wish to continue, please note that you require the
following:
- [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
- Hardware Compatible with .NET 6 SDK (While .NET 6 is compatible with most hardware, 
the project does not guarantee compatibility)
- System RID (Runtime Identifier) from the .NET Docs
  - [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog#windows-rids)
  - [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog#linux-rids)
  - [macOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog#macos-rids)
  - [iOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog#ios-rids)
  - [Android](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog#android-rids)

In the repository directory, go into the Terminal directory and run:

```
dotnet publish "Terminal.csproj" -c Release -r <RID> /p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained true
```

You may then find the compiled binary in `Terminal/bin/Release/net6.0/<RID>/publish`.

### Contributing Code and Hardware
Glad you're considering helping the development of StockNemo. Being an
opensource-freeware project, it is currently not sponsored by any company,
person, or otherwise. StockNemo welcomes all good code contributions 
(given they follow all necessary code and documentation standards).

To assist development of StockNemo, StockNemo appreciates donate of any
compute power. Contributors may donate idle hardware by installing and
running a StockNemo Testing Framework worker, which will be assigned 
distributed tasks to run. The hardware is required to be connected to the
internet, and available to run tests (CPU is mostly idle). **The Framework
currently only utilizes the CPU.**

### Much thanks to:

providing necessary information and data regarding Fixed-Shift Black Magic
BitBoards.
- [Smallbrain](https://github.com/Disservin/Smallbrain) by Disservin for
providing necessary information and data regarding constant attack tables and
check/pin bitboards. Smallbrain and Disservin have been crucial to the
progress made by StockNemo.
- [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) by the
Stockfish Team for providing numerous insights and making a brilliant engine,
used numerous times to debug StockNemo.
